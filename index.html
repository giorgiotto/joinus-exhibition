                To those who share the values of our <span id="brand">brand</span> and aspire to join the <span id="company">company</span> to actively contribute in its growth and visibility. Our <span id="company2">company</span> provides benefits and services to our <span id="collaborators">collaborators</span>: 
                <br>- <span id="ensuring">ensuring</span> rights and <span id="facilities">facilities</span>;

                <br>- ensuring the availability of <span id="training">training</span> and <span id="coaches">coaches</span> in the <span id="course">course of employment</span>, particularly <span id="language">foreign languages</span>;
                <br>- the flourishing relationship between the <span id="company4">Company</span> and its <span id="collaborators2">collaborators</span>.

                <br>

                <br>Finally, this new reality presents a challenge that rises above a mere <span id="media">media strategy</span>.  <span id="brand2">The Brand</span> no longer exists in small <span id="branches">branches</span> that can be <span id="compared">compared</span> <span id="startups">to startups</span> or small groups of <span id="freelancers">freelancers</span>.

                <br>We intend to actively contribute in the formation of a better society for the future.

                Exploring the overhanging text, some words might change on mouseover. The highlighted words are the ones that were originally used in the Islamic State’s official magazine “Dabiq”. The original sentences were rearranged and explicit contents were translated (masked) to bring out a text that holds the peculiar structure of a manifesto, as if it were drawn by a brand. <a href="ismanifesto.html" class="click highlighted">Read the uncensored text altogether here</a>.
