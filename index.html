                To those who share the values of our <span id="brand">brand</span> and aspire to join the <span id="company">company</span> to actively contribute in its growth and visibility. Our <span id="company2">company</span> provides benefits and services to our <span id="collaborators">collaborators</span>: 
                <br>- <span id="ensuring">ensuring</span> rights and <span id="facilities">facilities</span>;
                <br>- <span id="investing">investing</span> millions of dollars into services that are important to the <span id="employees">employees</span>;
                <br>- the state of <span id="health">health</span> and <span id="safety">safety</span> enjoyed in the <span id="workplace">workplace</span> under the <span id="company3">Company</span>’s <span id="administration">administration</span>;
                <br>- ensuring the availability of <span id="training">training</span> and <span id="coaches">coaches</span> in the <span id="course">course of employment</span>, particularly <span id="language">foreign languages</span>;
                <br>- the flourishing relationship between the <span id="company4">Company</span> and its <span id="collaborators2">collaborators</span>.
                <br>
                <br>Our <span id="collaborators3">collaborators</span> are <span id="working">working</span> <span id="with">with</span> <span id="partners">partners</span> all around the world. 
                <br>We are encouraging the youth to join the <span id="teams">teams</span> of the <span id="company5">Company</span>.
                <br>
                <br>We make a special call to the scholars, experts in <span id="business">business</span> jurisprudence, and <span id="creatives">creatives</span>, especially the <span id="photographers">photographers</span>, as well as people with <span id="graphic">graphic design</span>, <span id="video">video making</span>, and <span id="communication">communication</span> expertise, and <span id="analysts">analysts</span> and engineers of all different specializations and fields.
                <br>
                <br>Finally, this new reality presents a challenge that rises above a mere <span id="media">media strategy</span>.  <span id="brand2">The Brand</span> no longer exists in small <span id="branches">branches</span> that can be <span id="compared">compared</span> <span id="startups">to startups</span> or small groups of <span id="freelancers">freelancers</span>. It is now a real, if nascent and <span id="out">out of the box</span>, <span id="main">main</span> actor — more akin in organization and <span id="impact">impact</span> to the <span id="cocacola">Coca-Cola</span> of the late 1990s than <span id="pepsi">Pepsi</span>.
                <br>
                <br>We intend to actively contribute in the formation of a better society for the future. 
                <br>Let the world know that we are living today in a new era.
                <br>We are you if you’ll join the Project.

                Exploring the overhanging text, some words might change on mouseover. The highlighted words are the ones that were originally used in the Islamic State’s official magazine “Dabiq”. The original sentences were rearranged and explicit contents were translated (masked) to bring out a text that holds the peculiar structure of a manifesto, as if it were drawn by a brand.
